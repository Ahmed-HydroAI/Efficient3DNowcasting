# Efficient3DNowcasting

This repository contains the code and experiments from my PhD work on efficient 3D convolutional neural networks for radar-based rainfall nowcasting.

## 📘 Project Overview

This study explores a variety of efficient 3D CNN architectures (e.g., Depthwise, Grouped, R(2+1)D, Ghost) and benchmarks their performance and resource usage for short-term rainfall prediction from radar sequences.

Key objectives:
- Benchmark efficient 3D convolutions against a standard U-Net baseline.
- Evaluate trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and parameter efficiency.
- Provide  robustness tests under data-scarce conditions.

# 🌧️ Efficient 3D Convolutional Architectures for Radar-Based Rainfall Nowcasting

# 

# This repository provides code for the paper:

# 

# "An Efficient 3D Convolutional Framework for Rainfall Nowcasting: Performance–Efficiency Trade-offs and Adaptation to Data Scarcity"

# 

# This study proposes and compares multiple efficient 3D convolutional designs for rainfall nowcasting, focusing on accuracy–efficiency trade-offs and robustness. The tested variants include:

# 

# Standard 3D convolution

# 

# Depthwise convolution

# 

# Grouped convolution

# 

# R(2+1)D convolution

# 

# Hybrid convolution (mixed standard 2D+3D)

# 

# Ghost convolution

# 

# All models share a unified 3D U-Net-based architecture and are trained, validated, and evaluated on five years (2016–2020) of UK radar data at 5-minute intervals and 1 km resolution (grid size: 512 × 512).

# 

# The models use a consistent 4-frame input / 12-frame output configuration in a sequence-to-sequence prediction setting, enabling direct comparison of computational complexity, runtime, and predictive skill.

# 

# 📄 See below for instructions on running the models. For further details, please refer to the paper or contact the author.

# 💻 Setup \& Requirements

# 

# Clone the repository:

# 

# git clone https://github.com/Ahmed-HydroAI/Efficient3DNowcasting.git

# cd Efficient3DNowcasting

# 

# 

# Install required packages

# 

# Using pip:

# 

# pip install -r requirements.txt

# 

# 

# Using conda (recommended for reproducibility):

# 

# conda env create -f environment.yml

# conda activate efficientnowcast-env

#

# 

# 🚀 Usage

# 

# Run evaluation on all model variants:

# 

# python run\_predictions.py

# 

# 

# This will run inference on the provided sample radar sequences and save outputs in the outputs/ directory.

# 

# 📊 Outputs and Visualization

# 

# The script generates:

# 

# ✅ Side-by-side plots of predicted vs. observed rainfall

# ✅ MAE, RMSE, and CSI scores over lead times

# ✅ CSI curves for multiple rainfall thresholds

# ✅ Runtime and FLOP analysis (if ptflops is installed)

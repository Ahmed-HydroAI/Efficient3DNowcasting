# 🌧️ Efficient 3D Convolutional Architectures for Radar-Based Rainfall Nowcasting

This repository provides code for the paper:

**"An Efficient 3D Convolutional Framework for Rainfall Nowcasting: Performance–Efficiency Trade-offs and Adaptation to Data Scarcity"**

This study proposes and compares multiple efficient 3D convolutional designs for rainfall nowcasting, focusing on accuracy–efficiency trade-offs and robustness.  
The tested variants include:

- Standard 3D convolution  
- Depthwise convolution  
- Grouped convolution  
- R(2+1)D convolution  
- Hybrid convolution (mixed standard 2D+3D)  
- Ghost convolution  

All models share a unified 3D U-Net-based architecture and are trained, validated, and evaluated on five years (2016–2020) of UK radar data at 5-minute intervals and 1 km resolution (grid size: 512 × 512).

The models use a consistent **4-frame input / 12-frame output** configuration in a sequence-to-sequence prediction setting, enabling direct comparison of computational complexity, runtime, and predictive skill.

# 💻 Setup & Requirements

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahmed-HydroAI/Efficient3DNowcasting.git
cd Efficient3DNowcasting
2. Install required packages

Using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Using conda (recommended for reproducibility):
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate efficientnowcast-env

3. Download pretrained model checkpoints
Zenodo link

🚀 Usage
Run evaluation on all model variants:
python run_predictions.py
This will run inference on the provided sample radar sequences and save outputs in the outputs/ directory.

📊 Outputs and Visualization
The script generates:

✅ Side-by-side plots of predicted vs. observed rainfall
✅ MAE, RMSE, and CSI scores over lead times
✅ CSI curves for multiple rainfall thresholds
✅ Runtime and FLOP analysis (if ptflops is installed)
